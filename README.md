# TO-DO-LIST-APP

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the RISE Internship Python Programming Project. The primary motivation behind creating this application is to help students and professionals stay organized, manage their tasks, and improve productivity. Many people struggle with prioritizing tasks or remembering deadlines, and a digital to-do list makes it much easier to keep track of pending work.

The application is designed using Python with a Tkinter GUI, providing a simple and user-friendly interface. Tasks can be added, edited, deleted, marked as completed, and saved to a file so that they remain available even after closing the program. File handling is implemented using the JSON format for better structure and easy readability.


## Objectives

Provide a simple, beginner-friendly task manager.

Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

Allow users to mark tasks as completed for better tracking.

Save and load tasks from a JSON file for persistence.

Build a GUI-based productivity tool using Tkinter.


## Features

Add Task – Add new tasks with a single click.

Edit Task – Modify an existing task.

Delete Task – Remove unwanted tasks.

Mark Complete – Track progress by marking completed tasks.

Persistent Storage – Tasks are saved in a JSON file (tasks.json) and reloaded when the program starts.

User-Friendly Interface – GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction.


## How to Run the Project

### 1. Run the Python file

python todo_list.py

### Start using the app

Enter a task in the input box and click Add Task

Select a task and click Edit, Delete, or Mark Complete

Close and reopen to see tasks reloaded from tasks.json


## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I learned:

How to design a GUI application using Tkinter.

How to apply CRUD operations in a real-world scenario.

The importance of file handling and persistent data storage using JSON.

How small productivity tools can make a big difference in time management.

The fundamentals of project structuring and documentation.


## Future Enhancements

Add priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

Add due dates using Python’s datetime module.

Provide sorting & filtering options.

Design a modern interface with advanced libraries like ttkbootstrap or customtkinter.

## Conclusion

The To-Do List App is a simple yet powerful productivity tool that demonstrates core concepts of Python programming such as Tkinter GUI design, file handling, JSON storage, and CRUD logic. While lightweight, it provides the foundation for more advanced task management applications. This project not only enhances my programming skills but also showcases how Python can be used to create useful real-world applications.
